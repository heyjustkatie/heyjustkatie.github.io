                    Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right
                    thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and
                    most dwarves are lawful good.

                    Neutral Good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others

                    Neutral (N) is the alighnment of those who prefer to steer
                    clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what
                    seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many
                    humans are neutral.

                    Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.

          <h3>Alignment Spectrum</h2>
          <h4>Good vs Evil</h3>
          <p>
            Good characters and creatures protect innocent life. Evil characters
            and creatures debase or destroy innocent life, whether for fun or
            profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Good" implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the
            dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal sacrifices
            to help others.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Evil" implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil
            creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without
            qualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil,
            killing for sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have
            compunctions against killing the innocent but lack the commitment to
            make sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are
            committed to others by personal relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being good or evil can be a conscious choice. For most people,
            though, being good or evil is an attitude that one recognizes but
            does not choose. Being neutral on the good-evil axis usually
            represents a lack of commitment one way or the other, but for some
            it represents a positive commitment to a balanced view. While
            acknowledging that good and evil are objective states, not just
            opinions, these folk maintain that a balance between the two is the
            proper place for people, or at least for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral
            rather than good or evil. Even deadly vipers and tigers that eat
            people are neutral because they lack the capacity for morally right
            or wrong behavior.
          </p>
          <h4>Law vs Chaos</h3>
          <p>
            Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect
            authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall short of their
            duties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told what
            to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do what they promise if
            they feel like it.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Law" implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and
            reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include
            close-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition,
            judgmentalness, and a lack of adaptability. Those who consciously
            promote lawfulness say that only lawful behavior creates a society
            in which people can depend on each other and make the right
            decisions in full confidence that others will act as they should.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Chaos" implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the
            downside, chaos can include recklessness, authority, arbitrary
            actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote chaotic behavior
            say that only unfettered personal freedom allows people to express
            themselves fully and lets society benefit from the potential that
            its individuals have within them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has a normal
            respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to obey nor a
            compulsion to rebel. She is honest but can be tempted into lying or
            deceiving others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Devotion to law or chaos may be a conscious choice, but more often
            it is a personality trait that is recognized rather than being
            chosen. Neutrality on the lawful-chaotic axis is usually simply a
            middle state, a state of not feeling compelled toward one side or
            the other. Some few such neutrals, however, espouse neutrality as
            superior to law or chaos, regarding each as an extreme with its own
            blind spots and drawbacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral.
            Dogs may be obedient and cats free-spirited, but they do not have
            the moral capacity to be truly lawful or chaotic.
