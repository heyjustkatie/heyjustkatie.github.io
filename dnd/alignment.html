        <h2 id="alignmentSpectrum">Alignment Spectrum</h2>
        <h3>Good vs Evil</h3>
        <p>
          Good characters and creatures protect innocent life. Evil characters
          and creatures debase or destroy innocent life, whether for fun or
          profit.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good" implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the
          dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal sacrifices
          to help others.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Evil" implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil
          creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without qualms
          if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing for
          sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master.
        </p>
        <p>
          People who are neutral with respect to good and evil have compunctions
          against killing the innocent but lack the commitment to make
          sacrifices to protect or help others. Neutral people are committed to
          others by personal relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being good or evil can be a conscious choice. For most people, though,
          being good or evil is an attitude that one recognizes but does not
          choose. Being neutral on the good-evil axis usually represents a lack
          of commitment one way or the other, but for some it represents a
          positive commitment to a balanced view. While acknowledging that good
          and evil are objective states, not just opinions, these folk maintain
          that a balance between the two is the proper place for people, or at
          least for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral
          rather than good or evil. Even deadly vipers and tigers that eat
          people are neutral because they lack the capacity for morally right or
          wrong behavior.
        </p>
        <h3>Law vs Chaos</h3>
        <p>
          Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect authority,
          honor tradition, and judge those who fall short of their duties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told what to
          do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do what they promise if they
          feel like it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Law" implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and
          reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include close-mindedness,
          reactionary adherence to tradition, judgmentalness, and a lack of
          adaptability. Those who consciously promote lawfulness say that only
          lawful behavior creates a society in which people can depend on each
          other and make the right decisions in full confidence that others will
          act as they should.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Chaos" implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the
          downside, chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate
          authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote
          chaotic behavior say that only unfettered personal freedom allows
          people to express themselves fully and lets society benefit from the
          potential that its individuals have within them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has a normal
          respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to obey nor a
          compulsion to rebel. She is honest but can be tempted into lying or
          deceiving others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devotion to law or chaos may be a conscious choice, but more often it
          is a personality trait that is recognized rather than being chosen.
          Neutrality on the lawful-chaotic axis is usually simply a middle
          state, a state of not feeling compelled toward one side or the other.
          Some few such neutrals, however, espouse neutrality as superior to law
          or chaos, regarding each as an extreme with its own blind spots and
          drawbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral.
          Dogs may be obedient and cats free-spirited, but they do not have the
          moral capacity to be truly lawful or chaotic.

        <h2 id="nineAlignments">The Nine Alignments</h2>
        <p>
          Nine distinct alignments define all the possible combinations of the
          lawful-chaotic axis with the good-evil axis. Each alignment
          description below depicts a typical character of that alignment.
          Remember that individuals vary from this norm, and that a given
          character may act more or less in accord with his or her alignment
          from day to day. Use these descriptions as guidelines, not as scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first six alignments, lawful good through chaotic neutral, are the
          standard alignments for player characters. The three evil alignments
          are for monsters and villains.
        </p>
        <h3>Lawful Good, "Crusader"</h3>
        <p>
          A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required
          to act. He combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to
          fight relentlessly. He tells the truth, keeps his word, helps those in
          need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates
          to see the guilty go unpunished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor
          and compassion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lawful good can be a dangerous alignment when it restricts freedom and
          criminalizes self-interest.
        </p>
        <h3>Neutral Good, "Benefactor"</h3>
        <p>
          A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He
          is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but
          does not feel beholden to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing
          what is good without bias for or against order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neutral good can be a dangerous alignment when it advances mediocrity
          by limiting the actions of the truly capable.
        </p>
        <h3>Chaotic Good, "Rebel"</h3>
        <p>
          A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with
          little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but
          he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has
          little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to
          intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral
          compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a
          good heart with a free spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic good can be a dangerous alignment when it disrupts the order
          of society and punishes those who do well for themselves.
        </p>
        <h3>Lawful Neutral, "Judge"</h3>
        <p>
          A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code
          directs her. Order and organization are paramount to her. She may
          believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may
          believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you
          are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lawful neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it seeks to eliminate
          all freedom, choice, and diversity in society.
        </p>
        <h3>Neutral, "Undecided"</h3>
        <p>
          A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn't
          feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or
          law vs. chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or
          bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks
          of good as better than evil-after all, she would rather have good
          neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she's not personally
          committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves
          philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as
          prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of
          neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act
          naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it represents apathy,
          indifference, and a lack of conviction.
        </p>
        <h3>Chaotic Neutral, "Free Spirit"</h3>
        <p>
          A chaotic neutral character follows his whims. He is an individualist
          first and last. He values his own liberty but doesn't strive to
          protect others' freedom. He avoids authority, resents restrictions,
          and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not
          intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy.
          To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire
          to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from
          himself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but
          his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a
          bridge as to cross it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it represents
          true freedom from both society's restrictions and a do-gooder's zeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it seeks to
          eliminate all authority, harmony, and order in society.
        </p>
        <h3>Lawful Evil, "Dominator"</h3>
        <p>
          A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within the
          limits of his code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He
          cares about tradition, loyalty, and order but not about freedom,
          dignity, or life. He plays by the rules but without mercy or
          compassion. He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule,
          but is willing to serve. He condemns others not according to their
          actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank. He
          is loath to break laws or promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he
          depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral
          grounds. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not
          killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting
          children come to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that these
          compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a
          zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond being willing
          to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading
          evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as part of a
          duty to an evil deity or master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lawful evil is sometimes called "diabolical," because devils are the
          epitome of lawful evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lawful evil creatures consider their alignment to be the best because
          it combines honor with a dedicated self-interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lawful evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents
          methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.
        </p>
        <h3>Neutral Evil, "Malefactor"</h3>
        <p>
          A neutral evil villain does whatever she can get away with. She is out
          for herself, pure and simple. She sheds no tears for those she kills,
          whether for profit, sport, or convenience. She has no love of order
          and holds no illusion that following laws, traditions, or codes would
          make her any better or more noble. On the other hand, she doesn't have
          the restless nature or love of conflict that a chaotic evil villain
          has.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil
          for its own sake. Most often, such villains are devoted to evil
          deities or secret societies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neutral evil beings consider their alignment to be the best because
          they can advance themselves without regard for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neutral evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents
          pure evil without honor and without variation.
        </p>
        <h3>Chaotic Evil, "Destroyer"</h3>
        <p>
          A chaotic evil character does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for
          destruction drive him to do. He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily
          violent, and unpredictable. If he is simply out for whatever he can
          get, he is ruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of
          evil and chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard,
          and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized. Typically,
          chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and
          their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or
          assassinate him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic evil is sometimes called "demonic" because demons are the
          epitome of chaotic evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic evil beings believe their alignment is the best because it
          combines self-interest and pure freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents the
          destruction not only of beauty and life but also of the order on which
          beauty and life depend.
