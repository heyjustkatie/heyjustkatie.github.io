          <h2>The Nine Alignments</h2>
          <p>
            Nine distinct alignments define all the possible combinations of the
            lawful-chaotic axis with the good-evil axis. Each alignment
            description below depicts a typical character of that alignment.
            Remember that individuals vary from this norm, and that a given
            character may act more or less in accord with his or her alignment
            from day to day. Use these descriptions as guidelines, not as
            scripts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first six alignments, lawful good through chaotic neutral, are
            the standard alignments for player characters. The three evil
            alignments are for monsters and villains.
          </p>
          <h3>Lawful Good, "Crusader"</h3>
          <p>
            A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or
            required to act. He combines a commitment to oppose evil with the
            discipline to fight relentlessly. He tells the truth, keeps his
            word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A
            lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines
            honor and compassion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawful good can be a dangerous alignment when it restricts freedom
            and criminalizes self-interest.
          </p>
          <h3>Neutral Good, "Benefactor"</h3>
          <p>
            A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He
            is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates
            but does not feel beholden to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing
            what is good without bias for or against order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neutral good can be a dangerous alignment when it advances
            mediocrity by limiting the actions of the truly capable.
          </p>
          <h3>Chaotic Good, "Rebel"</h3>
          <p>
            A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with
            little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way,
            but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but
            has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try
            to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own
            moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of
            society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a
            good heart with a free spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaotic good can be a dangerous alignment when it disrupts the order
            of society and punishes those who do well for themselves.
          </p>
          <h3>Lawful Neutral, "Judge"</h3>
          <p>
            A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal
            code directs her. Order and organization are paramount to her. She
            may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she
            may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized
            government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you
            are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawful neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it seeks to
            eliminate all freedom, choice, and diversity in society.
          </p>
          <h3>Neutral, "Undecided"</h3>
          <p>
            A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn't
            feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or
            law vs. chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction
            or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character
            thinks of good as better than evil-after all, she would rather have
            good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she's not
            personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal
            way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves
            philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos
            as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way
            of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act
            naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it represents apathy,
            indifference, and a lack of conviction.
          </p>
          <h3>Chaotic Neutral, "Free Spirit"</h3>
          <p>
            A chaotic neutral character follows his whims. He is an
            individualist first and last. He values his own liberty but doesn't
            strive to protect others' freedom. He avoids authority, resents
            restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character
            does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign
            of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good
            (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make
            those different from himself suffer). A chaotic neutral character
            may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is
            not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it
            represents true freedom from both society's restrictions and a
            do-gooder's zeal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaotic neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it seeks to
            eliminate all authority, harmony, and order in society.
          </p>
          <h3>Lawful Evil, "Dominator"</h3>
          <p>
            A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within the
            limits of his code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He
            cares about tradition, loyalty, and order but not about freedom,
            dignity, or life. He plays by the rules but without mercy or
            compassion. He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule,
            but is willing to serve. He condemns others not according to their
            actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank.
            He is loath to break laws or promises.
          </p>
          <p>
            This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he
            depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on
            moral grounds. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos,
            such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or
            not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped). They
            imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled
            villains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with
            a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond being
            willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in
            spreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil
            as part of a duty to an evil deity or master.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawful evil is sometimes called "diabolical," because devils are the
            epitome of lawful evil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawful evil creatures consider their alignment to be the best
            because it combines honor with a dedicated self-interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawful evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents
            methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.
          </p>
          <h3>Neutral Evil, "Malefactor"</h3>
          <p>
            A neutral evil villain does whatever she can get away with. She is
            out for herself, pure and simple. She sheds no tears for those she
            kills, whether for profit, sport, or convenience. She has no love of
            order and holds no illusion that following laws, traditions, or
            codes would make her any better or more noble. On the other hand,
            she doesn't have the restless nature or love of conflict that a
            chaotic evil villain has.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil
            for its own sake. Most often, such villains are devoted to evil
            deities or secret societies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neutral evil beings consider their alignment to be the best because
            they can advance themselves without regard for others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neutral evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents
            pure evil without honor and without variation.
          </p>
          <h3>Chaotic Evil, "Destroyer"</h3>
          <p>
            A chaotic evil character does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust
            for destruction drive him to do. He is hot-tempered, vicious,
            arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable. If he is simply out for
            whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal. If he is committed
            to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his
            plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly
            organized. Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work
            together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he
            can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaotic evil is sometimes called "demonic" because demons are the
            epitome of chaotic evil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaotic evil beings believe their alignment is the best because it
            combines self-interest and pure freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chaotic evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents
            the destruction not only of beauty and life but also of the order on
            which beauty and life depend.
